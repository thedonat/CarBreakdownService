# RSR-Pechhulp

(Case Project)
Clients from RSR Netherlands can easily and quickly get help if they have a car breakdown. 

The RSR Breakdown Assistance app uses GPS to determine the exact location of the user and displays it on the map. The coordinates are important for the helpdesk that is assisting the client. Underneath the map is a call button which automatically dials the number of RSR Netherlands Breakdown Service.
